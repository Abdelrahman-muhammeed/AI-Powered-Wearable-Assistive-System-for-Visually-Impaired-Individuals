# AI-Powered-Wearable-Assistive-System-for-Visually-Impaired-Individuals
This project is an AI-powered wearable assistive system designed to support visually impaired individuals by providing real-time awareness of their surrounding environment. The system leverages modern computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze visual data and convert it into meaningful audio feedback, helping users navigate, recognize objects, read text, and understand their surroundings independently.

At its core, the system consists of a mobile application integrated with an AI backend server. The mobile application captures live visual input through a camera, while the backend processes this data using advanced AI models. The processed information is then delivered to the user in the form of clear and immediate voice guidance.

The system supports multiple assistive features, including real-time object detection, text recognition (OCR), currency identification, scene description, and object finding with spatial awareness. These features enable users to identify nearby objects, read printed text, recognize money during transactions, and receive descriptive summaries of their environment, significantly improving daily independence and safety.

Performance and reliability were key design priorities. All AI functionalities are optimized to operate in real time, even in resource-constrained environments, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. The application interface is designed with accessibility in mind, offering simple navigation, emergency features, and customizable settings tailored to visually impaired users.

The project is designed to be scalable and extensible. Future development includes integrating a wearable hardware prototype based on a Raspberry Pi, as well as a caregiver (parental-control) application that allows real-time monitoring, device management, and notifications through cloud services. Together, these components aim to deliver a complete assistive ecosystem that supports both users and caregivers.

This system represents a step toward using AI not just for automation, but for social impact, enhancing quality of life and promoting independence for visually impaired individuals.
